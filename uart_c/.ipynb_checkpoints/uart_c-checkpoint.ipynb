    "`UART2` channel (see the `#define UART2 2` line). However, if you have time and\n",
    "are in search of a challenge, you should try to make the three functions also\n",
    "perform the correct configuration if given the `UART1` channel. `UART0` is\n",
    "reserved for a special reset purpose and has different functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we found in the FLASH example, the register definitions and bit fields can be\n",
    "found in `inc/lm3s6965.h` in the `lib/stellaris` folder. The easiest way to find\n",
