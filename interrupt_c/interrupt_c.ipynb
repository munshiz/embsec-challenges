    "As with the UART challenge, you have been provided with starting `uart.c`,\n",
    "`interrupt_challenge.c`, and `startup_gcc.c` files. However, all three UART\n",
    "channels are implemented using the hardware registers. Your task is to modify\n",
    "the `uart_init` function for the `UART0` case so that it enables the **receive\n",
    "interrupt** signal. You will also implement the ISR for UART0, which must clear\n",
    "the interrupt flag, check for a specific received value, and then reset the\n",
    "device. The ISR must also be defined in `startup_gcc.c`. Finally, you must\n",
    "modify the `main` function so that global interrupts are enabled, as we\n",
    "discussed during lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "**uart_init**: You must search the Stellaris datasheet to find the correct\n",
    "register for enabling the UART0 receive interrupt. Just as last time, you'll\n",
    "need to find the correct regsiter definition and bit fields in `inc/lm3s6965.h`\n",
    "in the `lib/stellaris` folder. This should only result in one extra line in\n",
    "`uart_init`; make sure to enable the interrupt **before** UART is enabled at the\n",
    "end of the function!\n",
    "\n",
    "**UART0_IRQHandler**: This is the UART0 ISR. As we discussed, the first thing\n",
    "you need to do is clear the pending interrupt bit in the correct UART0 register.\n",
    "Once again, the datasheet is your best friend! After clearing the receive\n",
    "interrupt bit, the ISR needs to check if the value `0x20` was received over the\n",
    "UART0 channel. *Hint!* You can still use the `uart_*` functions in the `uart.c`\n",
    "file even during an ISR. Finally, if the value `0x20` is received, call the\n",
    "`SysCtlReset();` function to restart the device. This is a function from the\n",
    "Stellaris Driver library, so you don't need to worry about it. Just call it!\n",
    "\n",
    "**startup_gcc.c**: Even though you have written the ISR code, the device still\n",
    "needs to know what function to execute when the UART0 interrupt occurs. In\n",
    "`startup_gcc.c` there is a large table of functions, most of which say\n",
    "`IntDefaultHandler`. To define the UART0 ISR, you must change\n",
    "`IntDefaultHandler` to instead say `UART0_IRQHandler` on the line corresponding\n",
    "to the 'UART0 Rx and Tx' interrupts. You should be able to tell which line\n",
    "corresponds to UART0 by looking at the code in this file. Additionally, you need\n",
    "to add a function prototype for `UART0_IRQHandler` in `startup_gcc.c` before the\n",
    "vector table definition. You will have to declare it as `extern` because the\n",
    "function is actually defined in `uart.c`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**main() in interrupt_challenge.c**: This is the main function that runs to test\n",
    "your interrupt setup. You'll notice that no UART channels are initialized at the\n",
    "start. You'll have to add the appropriate initialization code for the UARTs.\n",
    "Second, the global interrupts need to be enabled. The first function needed for\n",
    "this, `IntEnable(<interrupt number>)`, will allow the provided interrupt signal\n",
    "to pass through the NVIC. You will have to search through the `inc/hw_ints.h`\n",
    "file in `lib/stellaris` for the appropriate definition to pass as an argument.\n",
    "There should be only one option for specifying the UART0 interrupt signal. The\n",
    "second function needed for enabling interrupts is to enable global interrupts to\n",
    "the CPU, which you do by calling `IntMasterEnable();`. You don't need to add any\n",
    "arguments to this, just make sure it gets called **after** calling `IntEnable`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the UART challenge, please ask questions! If you need help finding the\n",
    "right register definitions in the header files, or the correct interrupt number\n",
    "in the interrupts header, we are happy to help. Hopefully you are more\n",
    "comfortable reading and understanding the datasheet now, so you should be able\n",
    "to find the correct bits to write for enabling the UART0 receive interrupt.\n",
