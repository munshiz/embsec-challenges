    "Here, we are going to remind you of some functions of the Python\n",
    "language. We'll talk about lists, dictionaries, loops and iterating,\n",
    "and control flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists - a collection of data types. The items in a list can be altered,\n",
    "and have a fixed order. Also, there can be duplicates in a list. Items in\n",
    "a list are usually accessed by their index, which starts at 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create an empty list, or initialize it with some items already in it\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> list_a = []  # an empty list\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> list_b = [1, 2, 'blah']  # this list is initialized with data, the data can be mixed types!\n",
    "\n",
    "Add new entries to the end of a list with '.append()', or join lists with '+'\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary - a collection of data types, where each entry has a key\n",
    "associated with it. This key, not an index, is used to access the entires\n",
    "because a dictionary doesn't have a fixed order like a list.\n",
    "A dictionary can't have entries with duplicate keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create dictionaries similarly to lists, and access the items by their key\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> dict_a = {}  # an empty dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> dict_b = {'key1': 'val1', 'key2': 2}\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> dict_b['key_2']\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> 2\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to add to a dictionary, here let's look at two:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> mydict = {}\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> mydict['key1'] = 123  # option 1: use a new index key\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> mydict.update({'key2': 456})  # option 2: use .update() to add one (or more!) items\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops - Python provides many ways to loop and iterate through lists and data. For loops, there\n",
    "are generally two approaches. The first is by using an index. This is similar to how loops are\n",
    "done in C, but is a little cumbersome in Python. Instead, we often iterate through, shown in the\n",
    "second example.\n",
    "\n",
    "For dictionaries, we need to iterate, as dictionaries don't have indexes. The first dictionary\n",
    "example shows how we can iterate through the keys, and access their entries. An approach that is\n",
    "usually better is to iterate through the keys and values together, shown in the second dictionary\n",
    "example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Control flow - Besides the 'if' 'else' statements you will see in following examples, it may be\n",
    "handy to use the 'break' and 'continue' statements in loops. These serve different purposes - 'break'\n",
    "exits a loop completely, while 'continue' just skips to the next iteration of the loop. There is\n",
    "also the 'pass' statement, which is just a placeholder and does nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code cell demonstrates some of these topics. Feel\n",
