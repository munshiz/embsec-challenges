    "\n",
    "What are instruction sets? Think of them as a list of things the CPU can do. We use a combination of these instructions to create a program. Where other programing languages have syntax for logic and data structures, assembly languages only have this instruction set to modify data. Though there aren't complex language structures, like there are in Python and C, we are able to execute our instructions directly on the chip using assembly. In fact, all programs that you write are eventually translated to assembly before being executed. It is important to understand how these programs work at the assembly level since this is exactly how they are executing on the processor.\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "Different types of processors have different instruction sets, just like different programming languages have different syntax. This means assembly written for an Intel CPU will not run on an ARM processor, and vice versa. Even different types of CPUs within the same family might not even use the same instruction set. \n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "Intel CPUs are CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing) meaning it has more instructions that it is capable of executing, but that also makes the hardware more complex. CISC processors are often used in PCs, servers, and consoles.\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "Arm processors are RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing), and have a smaller instruction set. The smaller instruction set means that programs need to be written with efficiency in mind, while a CISC program may be shorter, since it has more pre-defined functions. \n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "Additionally, CISC processors have a lot of memory management instructions, so accessing areas of memory is common. While CISC processors have registers, RISC processors have more and operate using values loaded into these registers. Therefor, the only memory management instructions available to RISC is to load a value to a register or store that value to memory. "
